.SYNOPSIS
Builds comprehensive and robust application control "audit" and "enforce" rules for AppLocker and/or Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) to mitigate against users running unauthorized software, \
customizable through simple text files. Writes results to the Outputs subdirectory.

TODO: Find and remove redundant rules. Report stripped rules to a separate log file.

.DESCRIPTION
Create-Policies.ps1 initializes the environment and creates shared input files used to generate comprehensive "audit" and "enforce" rules for AppLocker and/or WDAC.
The resulting policies restrict non-admin code execution to "authorized" software, in a way to minimize the need to update the rules.
Broadly speaking, "authorized" means that an administrator put it on the computer, OR created a rule specifically for that item.
* AppLocker supported operating systems include Windows 7 and newer, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and newer.
* WDAC supported operating systems include Windows 10, version 1903 and newer.
* Rules cover EXE, DLL, Script, and MSI; on Windows 8.1 and newer, rules also cover Packaged apps.
* Allows non-admin execution from the Windows and ProgramFiles directories, EXCEPT:
    * Identifies user-writable subdirectories and disallows execution from those directories;
    * Disallows execution of programs that run arbitrary code that can be used to bypass application control (e.g., mshta.exe);
    * Disallows execution of programs that non-admins rarely need but that malware/ransomware authors are known to use (e.g., cipher.exe);
* Allows execution from identified "safe" paths (non-admins cannot write to them);
* Allows execution of specifically authorized code in user-writable ("unsafe") directories.
* For WDAC, optionally allows execution of code that was placed on disk by an authorized "managed installer" such as SCCM; Managed installers currently must be configured separately
* For WDAC, optionally allows execution of code that is determined to have good reputation as determined by Microsoft's Intelligent Security Graph

Rule implementation:
Rule types cover path rules, publisher/signature rules, and hash rules.
Rules allowing execution from "safe" locations are implemented using path rules.
For AppLocker, user-writable subdirectories of the Windows and ProgramFiles directories are identified using Sysinternals AccessChk.exe. Exceptions for those subdirectories are implemented within path rules.
WDAC user-writable checks are performed at runtime and skips the scan using Sysinternals AccessChk.exe unless KnownAdmins.ps1 finds custom admins defined
Exceptions for "dangerous" programs (e.g., mshta.exe, cipher.exe) are generally implemented with publisher/signature rules.
Rules allowing execution of EXE, DLL, and script files from user-writable directories are implemented with publisher/signature rules when possible, and hash rules otherwise, with options for the granularity of Publisher/signature rules.
Publisher/signature rules can also be created allowing execution of anything signed by a particular publisher, or a specific product by a particular publisher.

Scanning for user-writable subdirectories of the Windows and ProgramFiles directories can be time-consuming and is only required for AppLocker or when custom admins are defined. 
The script writes results to text files in an intermediate subdirectory. The script runs the scan if those files are not found OR if the -Rescan switch is specified.
It is STRONGLY recommended that the scanning be performed with administrative rights.
Once scans have been performed, scanned output can be copied to another machine and rules can be maintained without needing to rescan.

Dependencies:
PowerShell v5.1 or higher (Windows Management Framework 5.1 or higher)
Current (or recent) version of Sysinternals AccessChk.exe, either in the Path or in the same directory as this script.
Scripts and support files included in this solution (some are in specific subdirectories).

See external documentation for more information.

.LINK
Sysinternals AccessChk is available here:
    https://technet.microsoft.com/sysinternals/accesschk
    https://download.sysinternals.com/files/AccessChk.zip
    https://live.sysinternals.com/accesschk.exe
or run .\Support\DownloadAccesschk.ps1, which downloads AccessChk.exe to the main AaronLocker directory.

.PARAMETER Rescan
If this switch is set, this script scans the Windows and ProgramFiles directories for user-writable subdirectories, and captures data about EXE files to DenyList.
If the results from a previous scan are found in the expected location and this switch is not specified, the script does not perform those scans. If those results are not found, the script performs the scan even if this switch is not set.
It is STRONGLY recommended that the scanning be performed with administrative rights.

.PARAMETER ForUser
If scanning a system with an administrative account with a need to inspect another user's profile for "unsafe paths," specify that username with this optional parameter. E.g., if logged on and scanning with administrative account "abby-adm" but need to inspect $env:USERPROFILE belonging to "toby", use -ForUser toby.

.PARAMETER Excel
If specified, also creates Excel spreadsheets representing the generated rules.

.PARAMETER AppLockerOrWDAC
Specifies whether to generate policy for WDAC, AppLocker, or Both (default).

.PARAMETER WDACTrustManagedInstallers
Specifies whether to trust executables from managed installers(s) (default=true).

.PARAMETER WDACTrustISG
Specifies whether to trust executables deemed reputable by Microsoft's Intelligent Security Graph (ISG) (default=false).
