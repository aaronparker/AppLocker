  .SYNOPSIS
  Customizable script used by Create-Policies-WDAC.ps1 that identifies publishers or publisher+product/file combinations to trust.

  .DESCRIPTION
  WDACTrustedSigners.ps1 outputs a sequence of hashtables that specify a label, and either a signer or file rule.

  Each hashtable has a "label" property that is incorporated into the rule name and description, where appropriate.

  Each hashtable also has either information to formulate a signer rule for WDAC or an "exemplar" property:
  All information needed to formulate a signer rule can be found on WDAC block signature correlation events (EventID 3089) or by querying the certificate directly.
  * "IssuerName" is the common name (CN) of the intermediate cert in the cert chain and is found as the Issuer on a leaf certificate.
  * "IssuerTBSHash" is the TBS hash value of the intermediate cert in the cert chain.
  * "PublisherName" is the CN of the leaf certificate
    When using PublisherName, you can also add optional properties:
    * "ProductName", to restrict trust just to that product by that publisher (e.g. "Microsoft Teams")
    * "FileName" is the original filename property of the signed file and can be used to authorize only specific binaries signed by the Publisher.
    * "FileVersion" is the minimum allowed file version for the named binary or all binaries from the specified Publisher.
  * "exemplar" is the path to a signed file; all information to construct the rule is extracted from that file's signature and signed attributes.
      When using exemplar, you can also add optional properties:
    * "level" is the WDAC rule level used with New-CIPolicyRule and defaults to Publisher
    * "useProduct" boolean value indicating whether to restrict publisher trust only to that file's product name.
