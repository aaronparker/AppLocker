  .SYNOPSIS
  Customizable script used by Create-Policies.ps1 that identifies user-writable paths containing files that need to be allowed to execute.

  .DESCRIPTION
  This script outputs a sequence of hashtables that identify user-writable files or directory paths containing content that users must be allowed to execute.
  (The scripts favor publisher rules over hash rules.)
  Each hashtable must include "label" and "paths" properties, with additional optional properties.
  Hashtable properties:
  * label              - REQUIRED; incorporated into rules' names and descriptions.
  * paths              - REQUIRED; identifies one or more paths (comma separated if more than one).
                        If a path is a directory, rules are generated for the existing files in that directory.
                        If a path is to a file, a rule is generated for that file.
  * pubruleGranularity - OPTIONAL; specifies granularity of publisher rules.
                        If specified, must be one of the following:
                          pubOnly - lowest granularity: Publisher rules specify publisher only
                          pubProduct - Publisher rules specify publisher and product
                          pubProductBinary - (default) Publisher rules specify publisher, product, and binary name
                          pubProdBinVer - highest granularity: Publisher rules specify publisher, product, binary name, and minimum version.
                        Microsoft-signed Windows and Visual Studio files are always handled at a minimum granularity of "pubProductBinary";
                        other Microsoft-signed files are handled at a minimum granularity of "pubProduct".
                        ****NOTE****
                              pubruleGranularity is handled very differently for WDAC policies. WDAC rules use the pubruleGranularity to determine the default -Level but then falls
                              back to successively more restrictive options.The Granularity mappings are as follows:
                              pubOnly --> -Level Publisher -Fallback FilePublisher,FileName,Hash
                              pubProduct --> -Level FilePublisher -SpecificFileNameLevel ProductName -Fallback FilePublisher,FileName,Hash
                              pubProductBinary --> NOT supported for WDAC rules. Reverts to pubProdBinVer.
                              pubProdBinVer --> -Level FilePublisher -Fallback FileName,Hash (ProductName *not* included in generated rule)
  * JSHashRules        - OPTIONAL; if specified and set to $true, generates hash rules for unsigned .js files; otherwise, doesn't generate them.
                        NOTE: JSHashRules is *ignored* for WDAC policy generation. Hash rules are always created for .js files discovered.
  * noRecurse          - OPTIONAL; if specified and set to $true, rules are generated only for the files in the specified directory or directories.
                        Otherwise, rules are also generated for files in subdirectories of the specified directory or directories.
                        NOTE: noRecurse is *ignored* for WDAC policy generation. Subdirectories are always scanned.
  * enforceMinVersion  - DEPRECATED and OPTIONAL. pubruleGranularity takes precedence if specified.
                          Otherwise, setting to $false equivalent to pubruleGranularity = pubProductBinary;
                          setting to $true equivalent to pubruleGranularity = pubProdBinVer.
                        NOTE: enforceMinversion is always *ignored* for WDAC policy generation. MinVersion is always included in rules.

  Examples of valid hash tables:

      # Search one directory and its subdirectories for files to generate rules for.
      # Default granularity for publisher rules: create a separate rule for each file but allow any file version.
      @{
      label = "OneDrive";
      paths = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\OneDrive";
      }

      # Search one directory and its subdirectories for files to generate rules for.
      # Generated publisher rules contain only publisher and product names.
      # (Note that some Microsoft-signed files will also include binary name.)
      @{
      label = "OneDrive";
      paths = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\OneDrive";
      pubruleGranularity = "pubProduct";
      }

      # Search two separate directory structures for files to generate rules for, plus one explicitly-identified file.
      @{
      label = "ContosoIT";
      paths = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\MyContosoIT\Helper",
            "C:\ProgramData\COntosoIT\ContosoIT System Health Client",
            "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\TEMP\CORPSEC\ITGSECLOGONGPEXEC.EXE"
      }

      # Generate rules for three distinct files; do not recurse subdirectories looking for additional matches.
      @{
      label = "Custom backup scripts";
      paths = "C:\Backups\MyBackup.vbs",
              "C:\Backups\MyPersonalBackup.vbs",
              "C:\Backups\Exports\RegExport.1.cmd";
      noRecurse = $true
      }
