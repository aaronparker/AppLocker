.SYNOPSIS
Customizable script used by Create-Policies.ps1 that identifies publishers or publisher+product/file combinations to trust.

.DESCRIPTION
TrustedSigners.ps1 outputs a sequence of hashtables that specify a label, and either a literal publisher name, or a path to a signed file to use as an example.

Each hashtable has a "label" property that is incorporated into the rule name and description.

Each hashtable also has either a "PublisherName" or an "exemplar" property:
* "PublisherName" is a literal canonical name identifying a publisher to trust.
  When using PublisherName, you can also add optional properties:
  * "ProductName", to restrict trust just to that product by that publisher; with "ProductName" you can also add "BinaryName" to restrict to a specific internal file name,
    and optionally then "FileVersion" as well to specify a minimum allowed file version.
    When using BinaryName, you should also specify an explicit RuleCollection, to reduce the number of rules. (E.g., no sense in having a Script rule allowing "MSVCP80.DLL".)
  * "RuleCollection", to apply the trust only within a single RuleCollection. RuleCollection must be one of "Exe", "Dll", "Script", or "Msi", and it is CASE-SENSITIVE.
* "exemplar" is the path to a signed file; the publisher to trust is extracted from that signature. When using exemplar, you can also add an optional "useProduct" boolean value indicating whether to restrict publisher trust only to that file's product name. If "useProduct" is not specified, all files signed by the publisher are trusted.

Examples showing possible combinations:

    label = "Trust all Contoso";
    PublisherName = "O=CONTOSO, L=SEATTLE, S=WASHINGTON, C=US";
